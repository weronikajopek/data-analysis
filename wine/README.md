- **Pairplots**: multivariate scatter plots with regression lines
- **Correlation Heatmap**: visualizes relationships between chemical features

## Stats & Regression

- Descriptive statistics with skewness and kurtosis
- Pearson correlation computed manually
- Linear regression done manually and with `scipy`

## Tools

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`
